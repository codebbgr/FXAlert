# Contributing

Feel free to contribute, community is what keeps free software awesome!
I only have two pet peeves when it comes to my repositories:
  - Use appropriate code style, see Google's Java Code Style recommendation if in doubt.
  - Don't create unnecessary complexity. Refactor, and refactor often.

## Pull requests

- Pull requests are fine, but, if implementing new functionality, please first create an Issue.
- Small bug fixes and changes via a direct pull request are okay.

## Issues

- If you notice an issue (more than a minor bug or typo), feel free to create an Issue.
- Issues should always be created before making a Pull Request for a major enhancement.
- Issues can be as simple as "I want this feature", but if I don't think implementing is
  a good idea, I will close. No hard feelings!
- An example of a good Issue:
  - "I tested this on operating system `foo`, per the Javadoc, this method should do thing `bar`. On this
    platform `baz` occurs instead of `bar`."
  - "It is expected that `foo` happens when I call method `bar`, instead an exception is thrown. I have attached
    the following stack trace. It looks like method `foo` calls method `baz` with an incorrect argument." 
- Examples of bad Issues:
  - "Method doSomeAction() does not work."
  - "XYZ library does this, make yours do this too."
  - "Fix typo in README.md"
